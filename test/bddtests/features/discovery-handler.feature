Feature:
  Background: Setup
    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined

    # Give the peers some time to gossip their new channel membership
    And we wait 20 seconds

    Then chaincode "configscc", version "v1", package ID "configscc:v1", sequence 1 is approved and committed by orgs "peerorg1,peerorg2" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy ""

    And fabric-cli network is initialized
    And fabric-cli plugin "../../.build/ledgerconfig" is installed
    And fabric-cli context "org1-mychannel-context" is defined on channel "mychannel" with org "peerorg1", peers "peer0.org1.example.com,peer1.org1.example.com,peer2.org1.example.com" and user "User1"
    And fabric-cli context "org2-mychannel-context" is defined on channel "mychannel" with org "peerorg2", peers "peer0.org2.example.com,peer1.org2.example.com,peer2.org2.example.com" and user "User1"

    And we wait 10 seconds

    Then fabric-cli context "org1-mychannel-context" is used
    And fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/config/fabric/mychannel-consortium-config.json --noprompt"
    And fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/config/fabric/mychannel-org1-config.json --noprompt"
    Then fabric-cli context "org2-mychannel-context" is used
    And fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/config/fabric/mychannel-org2-config.json --noprompt"

    # Wait for the Sidetree services to start up on mychannel
    And we wait 10 seconds
